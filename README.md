# Functionality
    When the planner is openned, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
        Past
        Present
        Future
    Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
    When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
    When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
